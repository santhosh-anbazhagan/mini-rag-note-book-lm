# Mini Notebook LM 
### A RAG System with OpenAI, LangChain, and Streamlit

Mini Notebook LM is a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that transforms document interaction through advanced natural language processing. By combining OpenAI's powerful GPT models with LangChain's document processing capabilities, users can easily extract insights from their documents through a streamlined Streamlit interface.

## 📋 Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up Mini Notebook LM locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mini-notebook-lm.git
cd mini-notebook-lm
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed, then set up the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure OpenAI API

Set up your OpenAI credentials:

1. Obtain an API key from OpenAI
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root
3. Add your API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

### 4. Launch the Application

Start the Streamlit server:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🔄 System Architecture

Our RAG system operates through a streamlined process:

1. Document Intake: Users upload their PDF or TXT documents
2. Processing Pipeline: Documents undergo smart chunking for efficient processing
3. Visual Feedback: Token distribution visualization provides system transparency
4. Interactive Q&A: Users engage with their documents through natural language queries

## 🚀 Future Development

We have an exciting roadmap for future enhancements:

- Extended Format Support: Integration of DOCX and other document formats
- Advanced Storage: Implementation of vector databases for improved retrieval
- Global Reach: Addition of multi-language processing capabilities
- Cloud Deployment: Migration to cloud platforms (AWS, Azure) for scalability
